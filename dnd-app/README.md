# üêâ Taylor's Homegrown Organic Farm-To-Table D&D Assistant (Official Name Pending)
A personalized D&D application to organize my character's information during play.

## ü§® Why? Why This?
While playing Dungeons and Dragons with my friends, I sometimes find myself missing crucial information, forgetting spells, or getting confused in the heat of battle. You may think that this just means I'm bad at D&D but you're very wrong. I'm the best. I am the Game Boy - I am the one who wins.
The true reason for my failure is not my own: it's those darn papers. Flipping through your character sheets, the Players Handbook and other books, it's easy to get lost in the reeds. There are online platforms of course, but they're often cluttered with information I never end up really using in my campaign.
Inspired by D&D Beyond, but craving a more streamlined user experience, I used this as an opportunity to create something Taylor-made (haha get it? I'm also a comedian) for myself, all while improving my React.js skills.

### üîß Built With:
* __React.js__

#### üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Creator:
* Taylor Wilkinson (https://github.com/TaylorWilkinson) - Designer & Developer


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
